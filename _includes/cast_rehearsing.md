#### Rehearsing

Camberwell Showtime rehearsals aren't your typical musical rehearsal.

Not only do we work together rehearsing the show, but we have a heap of fun doing it.

In addition to item rehearsals, we play games, do challenges, learn new skills and do team bonding activities.

Whilst our rehearsals may seem strange for a musical, it's all for good reason. We've learnt a lot over the last 50+ Camberwell Showtimes and make sure we're not just putting on a great show, but also make sure everyone has a great time and learns a lot doing it.
